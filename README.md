  <h2>About the company:</h2>
  <p>
    Cyclistic, a leading bike-share provider, launched its successful program in 2016. Over the years, it has expanded to include a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago. The bike-share system allows users to unlock bikes from one station and return them to any other station in the network, providing a convenient and flexible mobility solution.
    <br><br>
    Cyclistic's marketing strategy has historically focused on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. This approach included flexible pricing plans, such as single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The finance analysts at Cyclistic have identified annual members as significantly more profitable than casual riders. Recognizing the potential for growth, the company aims to maximize the number of annual members by converting casual riders into members.
    <br><br>
    The challenge is clear: design effective marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. The team acknowledges that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen it for their mobility needs. The focus now is on understanding the differences between annual members and casual riders, identifying why casual riders would opt for a membership, and exploring the role of digital media in their marketing tactics.
  </p>

  <h2>Objective:</h2>
  <p>
    Design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

  <h2>My Mission:</h2>
  <p>
  As a junior data analyst for Cyclistic, my mission is to delve into the Cyclistic historical bike trip data, uncover trends, and understand the story from our clients. Through this, I aim to develop a strategy that effectively converts casual users into loyal annual members, contributing to Cyclistic's continued success.

  Feel free to explore the R branch for data processing, the Tableau branch for visualizations, and the Presentation branch for a detailed overview of the project solution.
